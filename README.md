# SESLIP-data-analysts

This repository is being used as a part of a test (by Alatstair Lee, supported by SESLIP and Social Fiance UK) to find out whether a GitHub repository might be useful to help CS data analysts share the tools they have created, find and use tools created by others, and to collaborate on maintaining and extending tools.

If we see promise in it, we will test it with the wider SESLIP data analysts group through its regular meetings.
